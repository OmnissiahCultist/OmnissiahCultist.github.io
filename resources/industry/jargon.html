    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Introduced by John Kindervag at Forrester Research in 2010 and later formalized by NIST, the Zero Trust Model assumes no user or device is trustworthy by default. It requires continuous verification of access and focuses on securing data and applications regardless of location.</p>

    <h2>Defense in Depth (adopted for cybersecurity in the 1990s)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/defense-depth" target="_blank">CISA – Defense in Depth</a></li>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        Defense in Depth remains a timeless principle, underpinning security architecture from enterprise networks to cloud deployments.

    <h2>Cybersecurity vs Information Security (~Late 1980s?)</h2>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> They mean the <strong>same thing.</strong></p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        I am sure there are tons of internet debates you can look into to get some actual background.
        To my understanding, there was no security industry in Information Technology (IT) at the beginning of the internet.
        Overtime it evolved from just being a generic role to being respected as it's own sector of IT - this was called Information Security (InfoSec).
        People suggest sometime around the 90s, cyber began to be used to evoke futuristic ideas. Both are still used today to describe the sector.
        Also - I like the sound of InfoSec better than CyberSec, but soon the cool kids may start referring to <strong>Cyber Resilience</strong> over Cybersecurity...
