    <p>
      Chronological (rough) timeline of key publications and relevant words/phrases that have become colloquial in the industry starting from the most recent.
      I will add my thoughts on their impact but keep the TLDR to what the concept explicitely means.
      Also - sometimes links may refer to what <strong>directlly</strong> influence the concept, and others may point to a relevant example source.

    <h2>NIST SP 800-207 – Zero Trust Model (2020)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final" target="_blank">NIST Special Publication 800-207</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Introduced by John Kindervag at Forrester Research in 2010 and later formalized by NIST, the Zero Trust Model assumes no user or device is trustworthy by default. It requires continuous verification of access and focuses on securing data and applications regardless of location.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        The Zero Trust Model has become a foundational philosophy for modern cybersecurity architecture, influencing enterprise policy, vendor solutions, and regulatory guidance worldwide.

    <h2>NIST SP 800-53 – Security and Privacy Controls (Rev. 5, 2020)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final" target="_blank">NIST Special Publication 800-53</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Comprehensive set of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. Serves as a widely recognized reference “dictionary” for security controls.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        NIST SP 800-53 has become a core compliance and risk management tool, influencing other standards and providing a benchmark for control implementation in both public and private sectors.

    <h2>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (2014)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework" target="_blank">NIST Cybersecurity Framework</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A voluntary framework of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk, with resources for setting baselines and goals for cybersecurity programs.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        The CSF helped unify cybersecurity language and priorities across industries, making it easier for organizations of all sizes to develop structured programs and meet regulatory expectations.

    <h2>Pyramid of Pain (2013)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html" target="_blank">Detect & Respond Blog – Pyramid of Pain</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Developed by David J. Bianco, the Pyramid of Pain depicts the "pain" cybercriminals feel when denied at various levels of attack indicators, from hash values to tactics.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        The model quickly became a visual shorthand in SOCs and threat intelligence teams, shaping how defenders prioritize detection and response efforts.

    <h2>Cyber Kill Chain (2011)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin – Cyber Kill Chain</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain outlines the stages of a cyberattack across its lifecycle during active exploitation.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        While some see it as dated for modern attacks, it still serves as a valuable teaching and analysis tool, and many newer models have evolved from it.
      </p>

    <h2>Loeb Model (2002)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon%E2%80%93Loeb_model" target="_blank">Gordon–Loeb Model – Wikipedia</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Created by Lawrence A. Gordon and Martin P. Loeb, this model estimates the optimal amount an organization should invest in cybersecurity to reduce the probability of a data breach.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        The Loeb Model is one of the few widely discussed economic approaches to cybersecurity investment, influencing budget allocation discussions at the executive level.
      </p>

    <h2>Defense in Depth (adopted for cybersecurity in the 1990s)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publication Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/defense-depth" target="_blank">CISA – Defense in Depth</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Originally a military strategy, later applied to cybersecurity. Emphasizes layered defenses so that if one control fails, others continue to protect the system.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
      <p>
        Defense in Depth remains a timeless principle, underpinning security architecture from enterprise networks to cloud deployments.
