        <p>
          I discovered Mimo as an app to help me not get rusty at coding and had a great experience with their UI. Their service is free(with ads)/premium and this is the link to their website (and no I am not sponsored). Mimo has several different languages and in my opinion does a good job and is very accessible for practicing or even learning a new coding language on the go.
