      <h2>Mimo - Coding Practice App</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://mimo.org" target="_blank">https://mimo.org</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A mobile-first app that is like duolingo for coding.</p>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
        <p>
          I discovered Mimo as an app to help me avoid getting rusty at coding and had a great experience with their UI.  
          Their service is free (with ads) or premium, and this is the link to their website (and no, I am not sponsored).  
          Mimo has several different languages and, in my opinion, does a good job and is very accessible for practicing or even learning a new coding language on the go.  
          The free version's ads are not invasive (as of me writing this in early 2025), and the app has the same feel as Duolingo.  
          I have only experienced using it on iOS, but I believe it is available on most other platforms.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Me Rambling: My thoughts on Duolingo and learning spoken languages are better saved for a separate tangent, but what I can say for Mimo is that the application to actual coding is very direct.  
          In my experience taking learning courses online or in person, the structure of Mimo is very similar to coding courses that slowly build your knowledge of the code while mixing in both guided and unguided coding challenges.  
          I think the accessibility of Mimo as a resource (especially for someone stretched for time) is its biggest selling point.  
          That, combined with its great UI and engaging content, makes it worth mentioning for me.

        <p>
          I love these courses and the community; Antisyphon is powered by BHIS.
          Antisyphon is really changing the game with providing cyber security training to students.
          Courses are engaging, informative, affordable, accessible, I am running out of adjectives to describe how awesome these people are.

        <p>
          Hack The Box is a great resource I honestly have never gotten too.
          It seems everywhere I look people praise HTB, and they have the respect from the industry to earn it.
          Since I have not taken any courses, I can't speak personally on them, but I have heard nothing but good things.
          They offer free/premium tiers to participate - worth checking out for sure!

        <p>
          I discovered KC7 by participating in lab work during a local BSides event.
          The content they have is engaging, informative, and actually hands-on.
          The learning curve is not too steap, but it is definitely a challenge that will teach you concepts and actually make you apply them!

      <details>
        <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
        <p>
          To call this website an awesome resource is an understatement.
          This website, by Bradley Duncan, offers a wide variety of pcap files with malicious traffic examples inside.
          The website is set up for you to pick from a list of packet captures and assume the role of a security analyst as you complete the tasks given (usually reflecting identifying the maliscious traffic and other parts of the capture).
          The author also provides an answer sheet with some short explanations for each packet (mainly with WireShark), there are some other resources on the site as well.
          Fantastic resource for anyone wishing to better their skills of packet analysis.

      <details>
        <summary><strong>My thoughts...</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Silicon Dojo is an online educational service hosted by YouTube's Eli The Computer Guy.  
          These courses can be attended live or watched afterward, with a "pay what you can, if you can" policy.  
          The videos cover various broad topics within IT (concepts, networking, cybersecurity, programming, etc.), so there is plenty of content to absorb.  
          In person (if you live nearby), Silicon Dojo hosts physical lectures where resources (like computers) are provided to follow along and engage in labs.  
          Otherwise, there are online class resources too.  
          <br>
          <br>
          I watched a decent amount of Eli's courses, and I can say I have gained a lot from them — especially as someone starting out in IT.  
          Eli's YouTube is now mainly personal vlogs and commentary, but his old videos are still up and contain plenty of relevant teaching content.

          Black Hills InfoSec offers high-quality training and regularly hosts webcasts and podcasts covering various cybersecurity topics, along with other information-rich videos.  
          Much like Simply Cyber, they have a passionate team and a friendly community supporting them.
          They distribute free tools, host Antisyphon Training, have blogs and resources available, host South Dakota's Wild West Hackin’ Fest cyber convention, and are a full-on cybersecurity provider to top it off.  
          Great community and people focused on moving the industry forward in a positive way offering a variety of learning resources.

          A cybersecurity community that is very supportive and inclusive; their website features various resources.
          They host the "Daily Cyber Threat Brief" weekdays going through some of the top cyber headlines.
          They also host Simply Cyber Con (cybersec convention for SC members). I have yet to complete a full course from them so I can't speak on that.
          An awesome team works to support Simply Cyber and it is something I am happy to support too, they have tons of learning opportunities so go check them out!

          He is one of the most prolific YouTube cybersecurity certificate study gurus.
          His channel pumps out study guides following the release of certification exams - the content is comprehensive and free (with more resources on his website).

          Recently, he has moved towards also introducing paid content that I plan on taking soon (it is offered through Simply Cyber Academy, but you can visit his website for more info).

          BlackPerl creates tons of great cybersecurity content, primarily focused on digital forensics.
          Their GitHub is a goldmine for various cyber resources/tools (some of which I have added in the tools).
          I find their videos very informative, and would recommend at least glancing at his content for anyone interested in cyber, especially for those aiming to get into DFIR.
          I have not taken any of his courses so I can't speak on them but he does advertise his own course's content.
