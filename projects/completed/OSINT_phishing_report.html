    <h2>Foreword</h2>
    <p>
      All names/contacts were replaced for privacy concerns, and pictures of any methods are not provided for the same reasons. This is not a highly technical investigation; it was more of a personal exercise in practicing OSINT with an actual application and relevance to a real-world scenario (not just a home lab or experimentation with tools).

    <!-- Brief -->
    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>
      An employee, John Doe, was solicited on WhatsApp by someone impersonating the CEO of CompanyX, Mark Smith. The conversation progressed into a request for John Doe to speak with a company-unaffiliated lawyer, Edward Lam, and keep the conversation confidential. The employee became suspicious and escalated the matter to management for verification. The incident was subsequently reported in an email chain with attached pictures and references to the conversation.

    <!-- Social Engineering Method -->
    <h2>Social Engineering Method</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>Threat actor prolonged the chat with dynamic responses and a consistent tone.</li>
      <li>Impersonated "Mark Smith" (used profile picture and a wrong number).</li>
      <li>Scripted speech: Claimed a new acquisition was being worked on and requested John Doe‚Äôs assistance with strict confidentiality.</li>
      <li>Attempted to have John Doe arrange a financial payment to a source after speaking with an individual (posing as a real lawyer named Edward Lam).</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <hr>

      <li>Shared breach information from previous data leaks.</li>
      <li>The roles of John Doe and Jane Lam made them realistic candidates for involvement in mergers.</li>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The threat actors likely accessed leaked data to identify and target CompanyX. While the exact motivation remains unclear, the attackers demonstrated a working knowledge of CompanyX‚Äôs acquisition history and key personnel. Their tactics suggest deliberate use of public information and compromised credentials to craft a believable phishing attack. This case highlights the importance of safeguarding personal information and regularly monitoring data breach exposure. Organizations should maintain strong awareness of their public footprint and conduct tabletop exercises to strengthen resilience.
