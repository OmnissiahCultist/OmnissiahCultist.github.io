    <p><strong>ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§</strong><br>
      This project page is actively being updated as I build out my lab environment and document my experience.<br>
      I plan on adding these too in future updates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Network diagrams showing the associated devices and configurations.</li>
      <li>Screenshots from Active Directory to provide context and visual references.</li>
      <li>Integration of images in a way that enhances readability and flow.</li>
      <li>A comprehensive deep dive section â€” either as a final overview or integrated with each daily log â€” to better capture my deployment process and key takeaways.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>ðŸ“… Mac Setup & Network Connection</h4>
        <strong>Things Done:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Failed repeatedly to get Wazuh on Windows Server VM.</li>
          <li>Shifted Wazuh deployment to my Mac as a networked device.</li>
          <li>Installed <strong>VirtualBox</strong> on the Mac and booted the <strong>Wazuh OVA</strong>.</li>
          <li>Successfully started Wazuh on the Mac.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Things To Do:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete Wazuh setup and install an agent on the host machine.</li>
          <li>Design network segmentation or VPN to optimize lab architecture.</li>
          <li>Align with production settings for DCs, policies, and OUs â€” even on a small scale.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>My Commentary:</strong>
        <blockquote>
          - Wasted too much time trying Wazuh on <code>win-server</code>.<br>
          - I want a stable AD environment that mirrors production logic.<br>
          - Once stable, Iâ€™ll layer in security controls and maybe even run some attack simulations.

        <h4>ðŸ“… Mail Server, Shared Mailboxes, and SIEM Planning</h4>
        <strong>Things Done:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Successfully configured <strong>hMailServer</strong> on Windows Server.</li>
          <li>Installed and configured <strong>Thunderbird</strong> for mailbox access via IMAP.</li>
          <li>Created a shared <strong>HR mailbox</strong> and a <code>noreply@strange.local</code> account.</li>
          <li>Added an auto-delete rule for the noreply inbox and configured a reply message.</li>
          <li>Built an internal distribution list manually in hMail (<code>users@strange.local</code>).</li>
          <li>Began planning SIEM deployment using <strong>Wazuh</strong>.</li>
          <li>Downloaded Docker â€” encountered "WSL version too old" error using WSL backend.</li>
          <li>Troubleshot WSL on <code>win-server</code> (unsuccessfully). May require Docker reinstall.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Things To Do:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve the noreply rule to prevent replies from bypassing deletion.</li>
          <li>Automate distribution list updates by syncing with an AD group or OU.</li>
          <li>Configure Thunderbird for multiple mailbox access for HR users.</li>
          <li>Begin Wazuh deployment using Docker on <code>win-server</code> (if feasible).</li>
          <li>Tune SIEM agents to monitor key events on DC, workstations, and Kali VM.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>My Commentary:</strong>
        <blockquote>
          - Troubleshooting Windows Server was a nightmare; I may need another solution.<br>
          - The extra emails/groups make the experience feel more immersive.<br>
          - Iâ€™ll shift focus to security controls first instead of tinkering with mail setup.<br>
          - Iâ€™ll refine the organization later â€” security config best practices come first.

        <p>This project is more about setting up a playground for me to get some hands-on experience with Active Directory.<br>
          Iâ€™ve had some lab work involving Active Directory through my CompTIA Network+ course (TestOut â€” offered through my community college), where they provided virtual environments of a fully deployed AD setup.
        </p>
        <p>I also gained lab experience from the course 
          <a href="https://www.antisyphontraining.com/product/workshop-intro-to-active-directory-with-dale-hobbs/" target="_blank"><strong>Workshop: Intro to Active Directory with Dale Hobbs</strong></a> offered by Antisyphon Training.<br>
          That course gave me a solid overview of central AD components, along with hands-on practice through a variety of labs. It was the biggest contributor to my desire to build my own lab space.
        </p>
        <p>My main goal here is to deploy Active Directory in my home network and then create an environment I can both harden and test â€” giving myself perspectives from both offensive and defensive angles on how AD can be locked down.
