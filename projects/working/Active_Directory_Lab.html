<p><strong>ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§</strong><br>
This project page is actively being updated as I build out my lab environment and document my experience.<br>
I plan on adding these too in future updates:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Network diagrams showing the associated devices and configurations.</li>
  <li>Screenshots from Active Directory to provide context and visual references.</li>
  <li>Integration of images in a way that enhances readability and flow.</li>
  <li>A comprehensive deep dive section â€” either as a final overview or integrated with each daily log â€” to better capture my deployment process and key takeaways.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

  <summary><h1>[ Initial Hopes and Dreams ]</h1></summary>
  <br>

  <p>This project is more about setting up a playground for me to get some hands-on experience with Active Directory.<br>
  Iâ€™ve had some lab work involving Active Directory through my CompTIA Network+ course (TestOut â€” offered through my community college), where they provided virtual environments of a fully deployed AD setup. In those labs, you would tweak configurations here and there to perform troubleshooting tasks or initialize services.
  </p>

  <p>
  I also gained lab experience from the course <a href="https://www.antisyphontraining.com/product/workshop-intro-to-active-directory-with-dale-hobbs/"><strong>Workshop: Intro to Active Directory with Dale Hobbs</strong></a> offered by Antisyphon Training.<br>
  That course gave me a solid overview of central AD components, along with hands-on practice through a variety of labs. It was the biggest contributor to my desire to build my own lab space.<br>
  Active Directory is a heavy-hitting concept for me â€” one Iâ€™ve had to review repeatedly to get a solid grasp. The hands-on labs brought me the closest to understanding it, so thatâ€™s why I want to experiment in my own lab environment and see how far I can scale and harden AD within my means.
  </p>

  <p>
  My main goal here is to deploy Active Directory in my home network and then create an environment I can both harden and test â€” giving myself perspectives from both offensive and defensive angles on how AD can be locked down.

  <h3>ðŸ“… July 11 â€“ Initial Environment Setup</h3>

  <strong>Things Done:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Created the initial Windows Server VM and Kali Linux VM.</li>
    <li>Established network communication between the two VMs.</li>
    <li>Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and promoted Windows Server to a domain controller.</li>
    <li>Confirmed DHCP allocation working via libvirt virtual network (NAT mode).</li>
    <li>Configured DNS and network settings to allow basic connectivity across VMs.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Things To Do:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify DNS and name resolution from Kali to Windows Server.</li>
    <li>Begin Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) setup.</li>
    <li>Decide on naming conventions for domains, users, and devices before scaling.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>My Commentary:</strong>
  <blockquote>- None. Straightforward actions and I am satisfied with progress.</blockquote>

  <h3>ðŸ“… July 12 â€“ Active Directory and User Structure</h3>

  <strong>Things Done:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Added Kali Linux as a BYOD-like client with a corresponding AD user <code>Kal Eye</code>.</li>
    <li>Created a new Windows workstation VM <code>HR-0002-win</code> and contextual workstations/OUs (<code>HR-0001-win</code> & <code>HR-0003-win</code>).</li>
    <li>Registered two users: <strong>Trevor Ross</strong> and <strong>Nicole Jule</strong>, both assigned to use <code>HR-0002-win</code>.</li>
    <li>Created a logical OU structure in ADUC for users, departments, and devices (simulating HR department).</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Things To Do:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up <strong>hMailServer</strong> to handle internal email for AD users.</li>
    <li>Connect email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird) to test internal mail flow.</li>
    <li>Begin simulating corporate communication workflows between users.</li>
    <li>Explore AD group and OU usage for dynamic management of users and devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>ðŸ“… July 14 â€“ Mail Server, Shared Mailboxes, and SIEM Planning</h3>

  <strong>Things Done:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Successfully configured <strong>hMailServer</strong> on Windows Server.</li>
    <li>Installed and configured <strong>Thunderbird</strong> for mailbox access via IMAP.</li>
    <li>Created a shared <strong>HR mailbox</strong> and a <code>noreply@strange.local</code> account.</li>
    <li>Added an auto-delete rule for the noreply inbox and configured a reply message (for announcement handling).</li>
    <li>Built an internal distribution list manually in hMail (<code>users@strange.local</code>).</li>
    <li>Began planning SIEM deployment using <strong>Wazuh</strong> for log collection and monitoring.</li>
    <li>Downloaded Docker â€” attempted using WSL as backend; encountered "WSL version too old" error.</li>
    <li>Troubleshot WSL on <code>win-server</code> (unsuccessfully). May require Docker reinstall.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Things To Do:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Improve the noreply rule to prevent replies from bypassing deletion.</li>
    <li>Automate distribution list updates by syncing with an AD group or OU.</li>
    <li>Configure Thunderbird for multiple mailbox access for HR users (shared inbox).</li>
    <li>Begin Wazuh deployment using Docker on <code>win-server</code> (if feasible).</li>
    <li>Tune SIEM agents to monitor events on the domain controller, workstation, and Kali VM.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>My Commentary:</strong>
  <blockquote>
    - Trying to troubleshoot the windows server was a nightmare, unsure what the issue is but I may need to find a different solution.<br>
    - There are plenty of other emails/groups I made so the experience feels more immersive to me... lol.<br>
    - I will be shifting to implementing security controls as I am sure I can get lost in the granular changes to Thunderbird or hMailServer's feel.<br>
    - I can revisit the organization later â€” I want to see what security configuration best practices come first, then structure around those.

  <h3>ðŸ“… July 18 â€“ Mac Setup & Network Connection</h3>

  <strong>Things Done:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Failed many times at workarounds to get Wazuh on the Windows Server VM.</li>
    <li>Decided to instead get Wazuh working on a separate device on my network (my Mac).</li>
    <li>Installed <strong>VirtualBox</strong> on the Mac and downloaded the <strong>Wazuh OVA</strong> for deployment (due to Docker not being supported).</li>
    <li>Successfully started Wazuh.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Things To Do:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Go through first setup of Wazuh as well as installing an agent on the host machine.</li>
    <li>Figure out network segmentation or VPN solution to make sense of the network architecture.</li>
    <li>Align with production settings even if on a small scale (multiple DCs, best practices for policies/OUs, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>My Commentary:</strong>
  <blockquote>
    - Wasted a ton of time trying to get Wazuh working on <code>win-server</code> just for the lab space.<br>
    - I want to get things stable first and actually stop at a viable AD environment that makes sense resembling a production environment.<br>
    - Once this is set, then I can introduce more security controls and maybe even run some simulations.
