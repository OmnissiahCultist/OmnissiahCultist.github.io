  <summary><h1>[ Initial Hopes and Dreams ]</h1></summary>

  This project is more of setting up a playground for me to get some hands on experience with Active Directory. I have experienced some lab work involving active directory through my CompTIA Network+ course (TestOut - offered through my community college) where they had virtual environments of a fully deployed AD that you would tweak here and there to achieve some trouble shooting or initiliazation of services.
  I also have lab experience gained from the course [Workshop: Intro to Active Directory with Dale Hobbs](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/product/workshop-intro-to-active-directory-with-dale-hobbs/) from Antisyphon training. I got a decent overview of central AD components as well as hands-on experience through a variety of labs. This course was the biggest contributer to me wanting to create my own lab space - AD for me is a very heavy hitting concept and one I have had to review again and again. The hands on moments I got the closest in my understanding so that is why I want to play around in my own lab space and try to scale and harden AD within my means.
  My main goal here is to try and get AD deployed on my home network, then try to create an environment that can be hardened and tested to get both offensive and defensive perspectives on how you can lock down AD.
